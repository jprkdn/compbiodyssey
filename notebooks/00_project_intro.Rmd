## ðŸ§¬ Welcome

This is the beginning of my journey back into computational biology. It's been a little while (almost 5 years), and since then we've veered off the career path. Today marks an effort to return to basics, understand the current landscape, rediscovery my passion for science, and learn/share along the way.

### Goals

-   Practice R and data visualization
-   Explore single-cell and multi-omics analysis
-   Integrate AI into bioinformatics workflows
-   Share progress openly via GitHub and Twitter

## ðŸ§ª Test Chunk

```{r}
# A simple plot test
x <- rnorm(100)
hist(x, col = "steelblue", main = "Test Histogram", xlab = "Random Values")

```
