# CompBioOdyssey

## Overview
This repository contains a computational biology project focused on single-cell & bulk RNA-seq, AI tools & methods, and tumor immunology data analysis using R. The goal is to explore state-of-the-art methods in computational genomics, develop reproducible workflows, and share open-source code and results.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Raw and processed datasets (small sample datasets for reproducibility).
- **`scripts/`**: R scripts and functions for data processing and analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: R Markdown notebooks combining analysis code and narrative.
- **`outputs/`**: Generated figures, tables, and other results.
- **`reports/`**: Formal reports or manuscripts.
- **`blog/`**: Blog posts documenting progress and insights.
- **`compbiodyssey.Rproj`**: RStudio project file for easy environment setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R (version >= 4.2 recommended)  
- RStudio (optional but recommended)  
- Install project dependencies using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) (if applicable):

```r
renv::restore()
```

### Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jprkdn/compbiodyssey.git
cd compbiodyssey
```

### Running analyses
- Open the RStudio project file `compbiodyssey.Rproj`.
- Start with the notebooks in `/notebooks` to follow analysis narratives.
- Use scripts in `/scripts` to run specific processing steps.
